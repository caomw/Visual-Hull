{"name":"Multi-view pedestrian tracking","tagline":"","body":"## Abstract\r\n\r\nFour cameras are mounted on four corners of a room, as Figure 1 shows. The pipeline is: \r\n\r\n1. four cameras capture images simultaneously by [boost thread library][boost];\r\n\r\n2. motion detection (GPU MOG2) is utilized to get the binary images of the four views;\r\n\r\n3. **Visual-Hull** is utilized to get the visual hull of the moving pedestrian;\r\n\r\n4. the ground positions are got by projecting the visual hull into the ground to get the projected image, and then segmenting the projected image by a pre-set threshold, and finally finding centers of the contours, see Figure 2 for an intuitional understanding;\r\n\r\n5. **Particle-Filter** is utilized to track every individual object, and a process called trajectory management (data association) is utilized to track multi-objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n\r\ncoming soon\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\n\r\ncoming soon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[boost]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/doc/html/thread.html","google":"UA-62097831-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
